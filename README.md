# CEASR

CEASR consists of a total of 55’216 utterances: 41’527
for English and 13’689 for German. They stem from 15
speech corpora: each sample contains a reference which
comes from the underlying corpus and was generated by
humans, and a set of machine transcriptions of the corresponding
audio recording generated by the ASR systems
(hypotheses). The corpus also contains varying metadata,
depending on the speech corpus which the utterance comes
from.

All utterances in CEASR are examples of either dialogue or
monologue human-to-human communication. They exhibit
diverse properties related to speaking style, speaking rate,
utterance duration, speaker demography or speech disfluencies.
The diversity of properties reflect the variability of
spoken language. All audio samples have been transcribed
with commercial and open-source ASR systems.
